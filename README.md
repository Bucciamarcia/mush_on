### 0.0.3

- Fixed bug that duplicates teams when they're saved in the same minute.
- Stats page updates immediately after a team is saved.
- Fix: Resolved issue where date range generation could incorrectly exclude the final day (current date) due to DST transitions affecting DateTime time components used in loop termination logic. Dates are now normalized to midnight during generation.
